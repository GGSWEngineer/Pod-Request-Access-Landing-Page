## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- how to style webpage with differing z-indexes
- how to take off default browser validation
- how to implement my own browser validation
- to always check for padding / margin on elements when the dimesions of a container don't fit
- if I'm encountering an issue its because of a bug in the code, and I just have to find it and fix it

### Continued development

- using the mix-blend-mode to get the image just the right shade is still an issue that takes me a while to fix(and still couldn't get it exactly right for this project)
- continuing to get better at Javascript and implementing it with my HTML and CSS, every project I get a bit more comfortable and understand it a bit more
